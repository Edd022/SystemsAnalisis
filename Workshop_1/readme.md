# Systems Analysis â€“ Kaggle Competition: Drawing with LLMs

## Competition Overview

This analysis is based on the Kaggle competition [Drawing with LLMs](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/drawing-with-llms/overview). The competition challenges participants to develop generative AI models capable of creating SVG drawings that visually represent a wide range of concepts. This task explores the intersection of natural language understanding and image generation, aiming to improve how large language models interpret and illustrate text-based prompts.

## Development Process

The selected competition was carefully reviewed to define the system boundaries and to clearly understand its primary function. Based on this foundation, the team began identifying the elements that make up the system, its purposes, and how each component operates within the whole, ensuring a systems-thinking approach.

From this structure, the interactions between components were analyzed, identifying key inputs, processes, and outputs. Next, factors such as randomness, sensitivity to change, and emergent complexity were considered to better understand how the system behaves under uncertainty or variation.

This process allowed the team to build a coherent and in-depth analysis, focusing not only on technical aspects but also on the dynamics that influence the systemâ€™s performance and stability as a whole.
